# Project Repository

This repository contains the work developed for the **FSI (Fundamentos de Segurança Informática)** course at **FEUP (Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto)**.

The project was originally hosted on GitLab as part of the course requirements and has been migrated here for archival and reference purposes.
